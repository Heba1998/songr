# songr


## Feature Tasks

1- Create a hello world route at `/hello`, that you can visit that route in your browser and see a rendered template come back.

2- Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit `/capitalize/hello` and get back an HTML page containing the response `HELLO`, or I could visit `/capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized` and get an HTML page containing the response `THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED`.

3- Create a basic `splash page` for the Songer app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.

4- Create an `Album class` to act as a model in our app.
An Album has a `title`, an `artist`, a `songCount`, a `length` (in seconds), and an `imageUrl` that is a link to that albumâ€™s art.

5- Create a route at `/albums` that shows three album instances.

6- Tested the constructor, getters, and setters for the `Album class`.

7- Update your Album model so that it can be saved in a database.

8- A user should be able to see information about all the albums on the site.

9- A user should be able to add albums to the site.

10- Create a Song model. 
```
A Song has a `title`, a `length` (in seconds), a `trackNumber`, and `the album` on which that song appears.
```

11- Ensure that the relationship between Albums and Songs is appropriately set up.
12- A user should be able to see information about all the songs on the site.
13- A user should be able to view a page with data about one particular album.
14- A user should be able to add songs to an album.
15- A user should be able to see the songs that belong to an album when looking at that album.

* the app should run the port 8081 and you can see rendered content according to end point.
